# ðŸ“˜Introduction

<p>In this HTML code, we create a form with two input fields: one for the date in the format DD/MM/YYYY, and a dropdown menu to select the target language.</p>

<p> Inside the script tag, we define the same daysData JSON object and translateDayOfWeek function as in the previous example.</p>

<p>We also add an onclick event listener to the submit button, which calls the translateDayOfWeek function when clicked.</p>

<p> Finally, we create a <div> element with an id of result, which will display the translated day of the week in the selected language.</p>

<p> We style the form, input fields, and button using CSS, and add some margin and padding to improve the layout and readability of the interface.</p>

<p> When the user clicks the Translate button, the translateDayOfWeek function will extract the input date and target language from the form, and use the same logic as before to translate the day of the week.</p>

<p> The resulting translation will be displayed in the result <div> element using JavaScript.</p>
